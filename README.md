# CountryTrivia2
CountryTrivia-Full stack

Country Trivia started as a simple command-line game that tested the user's knowledge about countries. It presents a series of questions about various countries, and the user needs to provide the correct answers to score points. It is a fun way to learn about different countries while challenging the user's memory and geographical skills.
CountryTrivia2 is an upgrade of the simple command-line game, with the integration of a frontend using HTML and CSS.

Note: Refer to the other branches for the final implementation
